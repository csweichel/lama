# Why is this called index.html?
#   I want to re-use GitHub infrastructure, specifically GitHub pages where the index file must
#   be named index.html.
#
# What's with the pre tags?
#   Because this file is called index.html, GitHub will serve it with an HTML content-type, which
#   causes the browser to render this script funny. But I want to be easy to read so that people
#   can understand what's going on here.
#
# The last line has to be </div> as on OSX we're seeing the remainer of this script and need to filter that.
